### what is elm-spa?

__elm-spa__ is a framework for building web apps in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org). It's not a "framework" like React or VueJS,
it's more of a framework like NextJS, Rails, or .NET MVC.

It provides simple tooling and a convention for creating single page apps, so you can focus on the cool thing you want to build!

Alsoâ€“ it comes with a built-in pale dude:

### routing

With __elm-spa__, routes are based on a standard folder structure, so you don't need
to write a bunch of routing and url parsing code!

### page transitions

life is better when things fade smoothly! __elm-spa__ gives you page transitions
out of the box.

this site uses it, click around and check it out!

### helpful docs and friendly people

The Elm ecosystem has a big focus on the human side of building things, so on top of the friendly compiler, an _even friendlier_ community, you'll also have access to a bunch of documentation!
