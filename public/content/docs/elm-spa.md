### quickstart

If you have the latest [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed, you can use `npx` to get started.

```bash
npx elm-spa init my-elm-spa
```

```bash
cd my-elm-spa
```

```bash
npm start
```

That's it! Your app will be at `http://localhost:1234`


### installing elm-spa

If you would rather just run `elm-spa` without the `npx` prefix, you can run this
command:

```bash
npm install --global elm-spa
```

And if you don't receive any permissions issues, that's it! If you do, [this NPM article](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally)
may be useful for you.

Running `elm-spa help` should now work too!
