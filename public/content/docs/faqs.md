## common questions from the community!

### how do i submit an faq?

If you think a question is common enough to make it in here, you can submit it
to the `#elm-spa-users` channel in [the official Elm slack](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com/).

If your question/answer combo gets 10 üëç emojis, it's officially considered "frequently asked"
and we'd be happy to add it in!

It's a ridiculous system, and I'm very excited to see if it actually works.
