# installation

## getting things set up!

### what we'll be using

- [NodeJS (v12.14.1)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [this dope Elm plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Elmtooling.elm-ls-vscode)

__Note:__ There have been [problems reported](https://github.com/ryannhg/elm-spa/issues/26) for older versions of Node, so make sure you're using (at least) version 12.14.1!

### installing elm tools

here is the command we run to install elm things:

```bash
npm install -g elm elm-format
```

The first package does the compiling. The second automatically makes
your code look pretty so you can focus on making the web app look pretty!
